This contents page is automatically generated using the ‘KCSOC Contents Page’ app script. 

To add a new page, ensure that the first line of the notes section of that page begins with “Title: “ followed by the name of the page

You may need to install it by first logging in as kcsoc.warwick, then clicking on “Tools”, “Script Editor”, “Run”.
Now the script should show up in the “Add-ons” section.
